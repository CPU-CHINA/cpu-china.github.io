		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<br />
		<p>Biocatalysts, particularly proteases, offer numerous advantages over traditional organic and transition metal catalysts. They are eco-friendly, using non-toxic reactants and producing green byproducts. However, they also have limitations such as narrow substrate adaptability, complex control conditions, and challenges in obtaining pure proteins. To address these limitations, several advanced methodologies for enzyme redesign have emerged. These include directed evolution, semi-rational design, rational design, and machine learning-based design. Among these, machine learning and rational enzyme design have gained prominence due to increased computational power and mature theories. Biocatalysts have become more accessible and cost-effective in industries like chemistry and pharmaceuticals, playing a significant role in innovative applications.</p>
		<p>Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS), originally isolated from Thalictrum flavum, plays a crucial role in the Pictet-Spengler reaction, facilitating the synthesis of (S)-norcoclaurine by condensing dopamine and 2-BPA. NCS also demonstrates catalytic efficiency in handling structurally similar compounds within the Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQs) family. These THIQs exhibit various therapeutic properties, including anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, and anti-coagulant effects. However, extracting THIQs from plants results in impurities and limited quantities. Chemical synthesis, on the other hand, involves complex steps, toxic reagents, and environmental concerns. NCS offers a preferable alternative as a catalyst, addressing these issues and finding success in various THIQs synthesis studies.</p>
		<p>NCS holds significant promise for industrial applications, leading to numerous attempts at enzyme modification. These efforts aim to harness its potential for large-scale production. Examples include creatively utilizing NCS to construct THIQs with spiral ring structures, introducing functional groups at the alpha position of the carbonyl group for pharmaceutical precursor synthesis, and exploring the introduction of heterocyclic and alkyl-rings into substrates. However, certain substrates, like heterocyclic compounds and bulky substrates, show limited reactivity in catalytic reactions. Additionally, determining the precise catalytic mechanism is crucial for structure-guided design, but despite several proposed mechanisms through structural analysis or molecular simulation, uncertainty remains due to a lack of experimental validation. Recently, machine learning methods have shown promise in predicting Kcat values and warrant further exploration.</p>
        <p>This study identified key mutation sites with significant effects, offering insights for the rational design of NCS. Furthermore, we proposed a novel catalytic mechanism for NCS in the conversion of dopamine and 2-BPA, supported by molecular simulations and experimental data. Additionally, we introduced a new deep learning model, RetKcat, for precise prediction of the enzyme's turnover number (Kcat).</p>
